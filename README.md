Summary: Retail Data Analyst (AWS & Snowflake)
In this project, I worked as a Retail Data Analyst utilizing AWS and Snowflake to drive data-driven insights for retail business operations.
The primary goal was to analyze large-scale retail data and provide actionable insights to enhance decision-making, performance, and strategic direction.

Data Extraction and Integration:
Used AWS S3 as the storage layer for ingesting data from retail dataset.
Built and maintained ETL pipelines using AWS Glue to extract raw data, 
transform it to ensure consistency and quality, and load it into Snowflake for further analysis.
